# SPACE-XPLORE

This project showcases interactive 3D visuals with the help of Three.js, Vite, and a custom-built UI. 

## Project Setup

To get the project running locally, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gunjankadam/Space-Xplore.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the three-bundle directory (which contains essential files for the 3D elements):

Since three-bundle contains sensitive or large files, I haven't uploaded it to this repository for now. 

Install dependencies for the project:

Navigate to the project folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```
### Step 3: Build the Project
Let’s first build the project using Vite by navigating in three-bundle directory:
```bash
npx vite build
```
Now, let’s build the project using Next:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will bundle the project and prepare it for deployment.

### Step 4: Start the Development Server
Once the build is ready, start the server to see your project in action:
```bash
npm run start
```
### Step 5: Open in Browser
After starting the server, open your browser and navigate to the provided localhost URL (typically http://localhost:3000) to see your project in action.

## Additional Information
This project uses Next.js for the framework, Vite for bundling, and Three.js for the 3D scene rendering.

I have used SVGs for various icons and images like the sun, globe, and window in the public directory.

The magic UI components, such as aurora-text and typing-animation, create an engaging visual experience.
